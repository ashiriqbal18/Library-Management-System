In this project we are handling the core structure of library management system consisting of 

1)User management which include User authentication during sign in along with forgot password functionality
  then in sign up we will be handling the username and email uniqueness along with email and password validation.
  It also include the feature for the admin sign in as well and all of this has been done by implementing custom dynamic array.

2)Activity managemnet which include all the activity that the user and the admin performed like "Booroow" or "Return" on which book of which genre on which date at what time.

3)Waiting list management which include the waiting list of the perticuler book.
