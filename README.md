# Library-Management-System

In this project, we are handling the core structure of the library management system consisting of 

1)User management which includes User authentication during sign-in along with forgot password functionality
  then in sign-up up we will be handling the username and email uniqueness along with email and password validation.
  It also includes the feature for the admin sign-in, and all of this has been done by implementing a custom dynamic array.

2)Activity management which includes all the activity that the user and the admin performed like "Booroow" or "Return" on which book of which genre on which date at what time. This was done by implementing a custom stack.

3)Waiting list management includes the particular book's waiting list. This was implemented using a custom queue

4)library management includes the insertion, deletion, suggestion, and traversing of a book. this was implemented using a binary search tree

filing is used for storing data so that the stored values can be accessed on each run.
